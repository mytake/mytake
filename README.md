MyTake.org is a mind bicycle for politics.  It's a website for writing essays ("takes") about U.S. politics, similar to Medium.com, except that users can link only to a finite set of [undisputed facts](https://mytake.org/foundation).  By focusing on primary sources that both sides agree are accurate and fair, we make it easier to engage on substance rather than being distracted by name calling or accusations of bias.

The MyTake.org "foundation" of undisputed facts includes only facts which meet all of the following criteria:

- must be a primary source (because primary sources aren't subjective opinions, they really happened)
- must be official (because it's easy to verify that they are authentic and not forged)
- complete and unedited (to make sure it can't be taken out of context)
- part of a large and complete set (to prevent selection bias)

Taking the U.S. Presidential debates as an example, they fit the rubric because:

- must be a primary source: a candidate might have lied, but it is true that they said what they said
- must be official: we only include the official stage debate, not backstage rumors
- complete and unedited: we include the full debate without commentary
- part of a large and complete set: there have been many presidential debates, and we include every single one - this ensures that MyTake.org can't be a victim of selection bias where we only show the subset of debates that support a particular viewpoint

If you'd like to write a take, [create an account](https://mytake.org/login) and get to writing!  If you'd like to read some takes, [see what people are writing here](https://mytake.org).

If you're a programmer or designer and you'd like to improve the site, it's really easy to run the site on your laptop by following the instructions in [DEV_QUICKSTART.md](DEV_QUICKSTART).  See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for our project management guidelines.
