        If our judges get to decide that the law means whatever they want it to mean, then we still live under a King, we’ve just changed his name to Judge. That’s why it’s important to apply consistent methodology when interpreting the law. But in this case, whether you’re a Textualist or an Originalist, I don’t see how the 2nd amendment allows for any of the gun restrictions in place today.
