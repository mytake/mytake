            The program - the Javits-Nixon or the Nixon-Javits program - would have cost, if fully used six-hundred million dollars by the government per year, and six-hundred million dollars by the state. The program which I advocated, which failed by five votes in the United States Senate, would have put medical care for the aged in 
            <strong>
              Social Security
            </strong>
            , and would have been paid for through the

            As a matter of fact it will be necessary to raise taxes. As Senator Kennedy points out that as far as his one proposal is concerned - the one for medical care for the aged - that that would be financed out of 
            <strong>
              Social Security
            </strong>
            . That, however, is raising taxes for those who pay 
            <strong>
              Social Security
            </strong>
            . He points out that he would make pay-as-you-go be the basis for our natural resources development.

            Every Republican on the Rules Committee voted against sending that bill to be considered by the members of the House of Representatives. Thirdly, on medical care for the aged, this is the same fight that's been going on for twenty-five years in 
            <strong>
              Social Security
            </strong>
            . We wanted to tie it to

            And I say a majority of the Republicans are opposed to it. The third is medical care for the aged which is tied to

            </strong>
            , which is financed out of

            Javits would have cost six-hundred millions of dollars - Mr. Rockefeller rejected it in New York, said he didn't agree with the financing at all, said it ought to be on

            But it compels nobody to have insurance who does not want it. His program under 
            <strong>
              Social Security
            </strong>
            , would require everybody who had

              Social Security
            </strong>
             to take government health insurance whether he wanted it or not. And it would not cover several million people who are not covered by

              Social Security

            The 
            <strong>
              Social Security
            </strong>
             system was based on a false premise, with regard to how fast the number of workers would increase and how fast the number of retirees would increase. It is actuarially out of balance, and this first became evident about 16 years ago, and some of us were voicing warnings then. Now, it is trillions of dollars out of balance, and the only answer that has come so far is the biggest single tax increase in our nation's history - the payroll tax increase for 
            <strong>
              Social Security
            </strong>
             - which will only put a band-aid on this and postpone the day of reckoning by a few years at most. What is needed is a study that I have proposed by a task force to look - of experts to look into this entire problem as to how it can be reformed and made actuarially sound, but with the premise that no one presently dependent on 
            <strong>
              Social Security
            </strong>
             is going to have the rug pulled out from under them and not get their check. We cannot frighten, as we have with the threats and the campaign rhetoric that has gone on in this campaign, our senior citizens - leave them thinking that in some way, they're endangered and they would have no place to turn.

            As long as there is a Democratic President in the White House, we will have a strong and viable 
            <strong>
              Social Security
            </strong>
             System, free of the threat of bankruptcy. Although Governor Reagan has changed his position lately, on four different occasions, he has advocated making 
            <strong>
              Social Security
            </strong>
             a voluntary system, which would, in effect, very quickly bankrupt it. I noticed also in The Wall Street Journal early this week, that a preliminary report of his task force advocates making 
            <strong>
              Social Security
            </strong>
             more sound by reducing the adjustments in 
            <strong>
              Social Security
            </strong>
             for the retired people to compensate for the impact of inflation. These kinds of approaches are very dangerous to the security, and the well-being and the peace of mind of the retired people of this country and those approaching retirement age. But no matter what it takes in the future to keep 
            <strong>
              Social Security
            </strong>
             sound, it must be kept that way. And although there was a serious threat to the 
            <strong>
              Social Security
            </strong>
             System and its integrity during the 1976 campaign and when I became President, the action of a Democratic Congress working with me has been to put 
            <strong>
              Social Security

            It, as I said, delayed the actuarial imbalance falling on us for just a few years with that increase in taxes, and I don't believe we can go on increasing the tax, because the problem for the young people today is that they're paying in far more than they can ever expect to get out. Now, again this statement that somehow, I wanted to destroy it and I just changed my tune, that I am - was for voluntary 
            <strong>
              Social Security
            </strong>
            , which would mean the ruin of it. Mr. President, the voluntary thing that I suggested many years ago was that a young man orphaned and raised by an aunt who died, his aunt was ineligible for 
            <strong>
              Social Security
            </strong>
             insurance because she was not his mother. And I suggested that if this is an insurance program, certainly the person who's paying in should be able to name his own beneficiaries and that's the closest I have ever come to anything voluntary with 
            <strong>
              Social Security
            </strong>
            . I, too, am pledged to a

             and Medicare has been very important to provide some modicum of aid for senior citizens in the retention of health benefits. Governor Reagan, as a matter of fact, began his political career campaigning around this nation against Medicare.

            It comes out of the general fund, that something should be done about it. I think it's disgraceful that the Disability Insurance Fund in

              Social Security

             finds checks going every month to tens of thousands of people who are locked up in our institutions for crime or for mental illness, and they are receiving disability checks from

              Social Security
            </strong>
            , Medicare, national health insurance typifies, as vividly as any other subject tonight, the basic historical differences between the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. The allusions to basic changes in the minimum wage is another, and the deleterious comments that Governor Reagan has made about unemployment compensation.

            Absolutely, and I have proposed over a hundred billion dollars in cuts in Federal spending over four years, but I am not going to cut it out of

            Well, that's exactly the commitment that was made to the American people in 1980: He would never reduce benefits. And of course, what happened right after the election is they proposed to cut

             benefits by 25 percent - reducing the adjustment for inflation, cutting out minimum benefits for the poorest on

            Well, whether he does or not, let me suggest my own idea about the leadership factor, and since you've asked it. And, incidentally, I might say that with regard to the 25-percent cut to 
            <strong>
              Social Security
            </strong>
             - before I get to the answer to your question - the only 25-percent cut that I know of was accompanying that huge 1977 tax increase, was a cut of 25 percent in the benefits for every American who was born after 1916. Now, leadership.

             was due to go bankrupt before 1983. Any proposals that I made at that time were at the request of the chairman, a Democrat, of one of the leading committees, who said we have to do something before the program goes broke and the checks bounce.

            At the same time every year, it increased the amount of money - virtually every year, there may have been one or two that were skipped in there - that was subject to that tax. Today it is up to about 38,000 dollars of earnings that is subject to the payroll tax for

            All right. Now, 
            <strong>
              Social Security
            </strong>
            , let's lay it to rest once and for all. I told you never would I do such a thing. But I tell you also now, 
            <strong>
              Social Security
            </strong>
             has nothing to do with the deficit. 
            <strong>
              Social Security
            </strong>
             is totally funded by the payroll tax levied on employer and employee. If you reduce the outgo of 
            <strong>
              Social Security
            </strong>
            , that money would not go into the general fund to reduce a deficit. It would go into the 
            <strong>
              Social Security
            </strong>
             Trust Fund. So, 
            <strong>
              Social Security
            </strong>
             has nothing to do with balancing a budget or erasing or lowering the deficit. Now, again, to get to whether I have - am depending on magic, I think I have talked in straight economic terms about a program of recovery that was - I was told wouldn't work.

            I don't think this nation is composed of people who care only for themselves. And when we sought to assault 
            <strong>
              Social Security
            </strong>
             and Medicare, as the record shows we did, I think that was mean-spirited. When we terminated 400,000 desperate, hopeless, defenseless Americans who were on disability - confused and unable to defend themselves, and just laid them out on the street, as we did for four years, I don't think that's what America is all about.

            The American Medical, Hospital Association, the Nurses Association, the Catholic Hospital Association all said hundreds of hospitals could close and people would be hurt badly under the Dole-Gingrich Medicare plan that I vetoed. And now with this risky $550 billion tax scheme of Senator Dole's, even his own friends, his campaign co-chair, Senator D'Amato, says that they can't possibly pay for it without cutting Medicare more and cutting 
            <strong>
              Social Security
            </strong>
             as well, according to him. Now, my balanced budget plan adds ten years to the life of the Medicare trust fund, ten years.

            There are lots of issues that we are going to be dealing with here tonight. And we have a question from Langdon in Ballston Spa, New York, and that's about huge unfunded obligations for 
            <strong>
              Social Security
            </strong>
            , Medicare, and other entitlement programs that will soon eat up all of the revenue that's in place and then go into a deficit position. Since the rules are pretty loose here, I'm going to add my own to this one.

            Instead of having a discussion, let me just ask you as a coda to that. Would you give Congress a date certain to reform 
            <strong>
              Social Security
            </strong>
             and Medicare within two years after you take office? Because in a bipartisan way, everyone agrees, that's a big ticking time bomb that will eat us up maybe even more than the mortgage crisis.

            We're going to have a lot of work to do, so I can't guarantee that we're going to do it in the next two years, but I'd like to do it in my first term as president. But I think it's important to understand, we're not going to solve

              Social Security

             and Medicare unless we understand the rest of our tax policies. And you know, Senator McCain, I think the "Straight Talk Express" lost a wheel on that one.

            Now, if we get our tax policies right so that they're good for the middle class, if we reverse the policies of the last eight years that got us into this fix in the first place and that Senator McCain supported, then we are going to be in a position to deal with 
            <strong>
              Social Security
            </strong>
             and deal with Medicare, because we will have a health care plan that actually works for you, reduces spending and costs over the long term, and 
            <strong>
              Social Security
            </strong>
             that is stable and solvent for all Americans and not just some.

            But it is - the basic structure is sound. But - but I want to talk about the values behind 
            <strong>
              Social Security

             and Medicare, and then talk about Medicare, because that's the big driver of our deficits right now. My grandmother - some of you know - helped to raise me.

            So the way for us to deal with Medicare in particular is to lower health care costs. When it comes to 
            <strong>
              Social Security
            </strong>
            , as I said, you don't need a major structural change in order to make sure that 
            <strong>
              Social Security
            </strong>
             is there for the future.

            Well, Jim, our seniors depend on these programs, and I know anytime we talk about entitlements, people become concerned that something's going to happen that's going to change their life for the worse. And the answer is neither the president nor I are proposing any changes for any current retirees or near retirees, either to 
            <strong>
              Social Security
            </strong>
             or Medicare. So if you're 60 or around 60 or older, you don't need to listen any further.

            But the idea of cutting 716 billion dollars from Medicare to be able to balance the additional cost of Obamacare is, in my opinion, a mistake. And with regards to young people coming along, I've got proposals to make sure Medicare and 
            <strong>
              Social Security
            </strong>
             are there for them without any question.
