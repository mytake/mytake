          What I have talked about, however, the kind of programs that I talk about, in my judgment, are uh - fiscally sound. Medical care for the aged, I would put under 
          <strong>
            social security
          </strong>
          . The Vice President and I disagree on this.

          The program - the Javits-Nixon or the Nixon-Javits program - would have cost, if fully used six-hundred million dollars by the government per year, and six-hundred million dollars by the state. The program which I advocated, which failed by five votes in the United States Senate, would have put medical care for the aged in 
          <strong>
            Social Security
          </strong>
          , and would have been paid for through the 
          <strong>
            Social Security
          </strong>
           System and the 
          <strong>
            Social Security
          </strong>
           tax. Secondly, I support federal aid to education and federal aid for teachers' salaries.

          As a matter of fact it will be necessary to raise taxes. As Senator Kennedy points out that as far as his one proposal is concerned - the one for medical care for the aged - that that would be financed out of 
          <strong>
            Social Security
          </strong>
          . That, however, is raising taxes for those who pay 
          <strong>
            Social Security
          </strong>
          . He points out that he would make pay-as-you-go be the basis for our natural resources development.

          Every Republican on the Rules Committee voted against sending that bill to be considered by the members of the House of Representatives. Thirdly, on medical care for the aged, this is the same fight that's been going on for twenty-five years in

            Social Security

          , which is financed out of

          Javits would have cost six-hundred millions of dollars - Mr. Rockefeller rejected it in New York, said he didn't agree with the financing at all, said it ought to be on 
          <strong>

          But it compels nobody to have insurance who does not want it. His program under 
          <strong>
            Social Security
          </strong>
          , would require everybody who had 
          <strong>
            Social Security

           to take government health insurance whether he wanted it or not. And it would not cover several million people who are not covered by

          Our program was an amendment to the Kerr bill. The Kerr bill provided assistance to all those who were not on 
          <strong>
            Social Security
          </strong>
          . I think it's a very clear contrast. 1935, when the 
          <strong>
            Social Security
          </strong>
           Act was written, ninety-four out of ninety-five Republicans voted against it. Mr. Landon ran in 1936 to repeal it.

          Third, I think it's possible to gain a seven hundred million to a billion dollars through tax changes which I believe would close up loof- loopholes on dividend withholding, on expense accounts. Fourthly, I have suggested that the medical care for the aged – and the bill which the Congress now has passed and the President signed if fully implemented would cost a billion dollars on the Treasury – out of Treasury funds and a billion dollars by the states – the proposal that I have put forward and which many of the members of my party support is for medical care financed under 
          <strong>
            Social Security
          </strong>
          ; which would be financed under the 
          <strong>
            Social Security
          </strong>
           taxes; which is less than three cents a day per person for medical care, doctors' bills, nurses, hospitals, when they retire. It is actuarially sound.

            Social Security
          </strong>
           system was based on a false premise, with regard to how fast the number of workers would increase and how fast the number of retirees would increase. It is actuarially out of balance, and this first became evident about 16 years ago, and some of us were voicing warnings then. Now, it is trillions of dollars out of balance, and the only answer that has come so far is the biggest single tax increase in our nation's history - the payroll tax increase for 
          <strong>
            Social Security
          </strong>
           - which will only put a band-aid on this and postpone the day of reckoning by a few years at most. What is needed is a study that I have proposed by a task force to look - of experts to look into this entire problem as to how it can be reformed and made actuarially sound, but with the premise that no one presently dependent on 
          <strong>

           is going to have the rug pulled out from under them and not get their check.

          As long as there is a Democratic President in the White House, we will have a strong and viable 
          <strong>
            Social Security
          </strong>
           System, free of the threat of bankruptcy. Although Governor Reagan has changed his position lately, on four different occasions, he has advocated making 
          <strong>
            Social Security
          </strong>
           a voluntary system, which would, in effect, very quickly bankrupt it. I noticed also in The Wall Street Journal early this week, that a preliminary report of his task force advocates making 
          <strong>
            Social Security
          </strong>
           more sound by reducing the adjustments in 
          <strong>
            Social Security
          </strong>
           for the retired people to compensate for the impact of inflation. These kinds of approaches are very dangerous to the security, and the well-being and the peace of mind of the retired people of this country and those approaching retirement age. But no matter what it takes in the future to keep 
          <strong>
            Social Security
          </strong>
           sound, it must be kept that way. And although there was a serious threat to the 
          <strong>
            Social Security
          </strong>
           System and its integrity during the 1976 campaign and when I became President, the action of a Democratic Congress working with me has been to put 
          <strong>
            Social Security

           back on a sound financial basis. That's the way it will stay.

          It, as I said, delayed the actuarial imbalance falling on us for just a few years with that increase in taxes, and I don't believe we can go on increasing the tax, because the problem for the young people today is that they're paying in far more than they can ever expect to get out. Now, again this statement that somehow, I wanted to destroy it and I just changed my tune, that I am - was for voluntary 
          <strong>
            Social Security
          </strong>
          , which would mean the ruin of it. Mr. President, the voluntary thing that I suggested many years ago was that a young man orphaned and raised by an aunt who died, his aunt was ineligible for 
          <strong>
            Social Security
          </strong>
           insurance because she was not his mother. And I suggested that if this is an insurance program, certainly the person who's paying in should be able to name his own beneficiaries and that's the closest I have ever come to anything voluntary with 
          <strong>
            Social Security
          </strong>
          . I, too, am pledged to a

           program that will reassure these senior citizens of ours they're going to continue to get their money. There are some changes I'd like to make.

          These constant suggestions that the basic 
          <strong>
            Social Security
          </strong>
           System should be changed does cause concern and consternation among the aged of our country. It's obvious that we should have a commitment to them, that 
          <strong>
            Social Security
          </strong>
           benefits should not be taxed and that there would be no peremptory change in the standards by which 
          <strong>
            Social Security
          </strong>
           payments are made to the retired people. We also need to continue to index the 
          <strong>
            Social Security
          </strong>
           payments, so that if inflation rises, the 
          <strong>
            Social Security
          </strong>
           payments would rise a commensurate degree to let the buying power of the 
          <strong>
            Social Security
          </strong>
           check continue intact. In the past, the relationship between 
          <strong>
            Social Security
          </strong>
           and Medicare has been very important to provide some modicum of aid for senior citizens in the retention of health benefits. Governor Reagan, as a matter of fact, began his political career campaigning around this nation against Medicare.

          It comes out of the general fund, that something should be done about it. I think it's disgraceful that the Disability Insurance Fund in

           finds checks going every month to tens of thousands of people who are locked up in our institutions for crime or for mental illness, and they are receiving disability checks from

            Social Security

          , Medicare, national health insurance typifies, as vividly as any other subject tonight, the basic historical differences between the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. The allusions to basic changes in the minimum wage is another, and the deleterious comments that Governor Reagan has made about unemployment compensation.

          Well, that's exactly the commitment that was made to the American people in 1980: He would never reduce benefits. And of course, what happened right after the election is they proposed to cut

           was due to go bankrupt before 1983. Any proposals that I made at that time were at the request of the chairman, a Democrat, of one of the leading committees, who said we have to do something before the program goes broke and the checks bounce.

          At the same time every year, it increased the amount of money - virtually every year, there may have been one or two that were skipped in there - that was subject to that tax. Today it is up to about 38,000 dollars of earnings that is subject to the payroll tax for

          . And that tax, there are no deductions, so a person making anywhere from 10, 15, 20 - they're paying that tax on the full gross earnings that they have after they have already paid an income tax on that same amount of money.

          All right. Now, 
          <strong>
            Social Security
          </strong>
          , let's lay it to rest once and for all. I told you never would I do such a thing. But I tell you also now, 
          <strong>
            Social Security
          </strong>
           has nothing to do with the deficit. 
          <strong>
            Social Security
          </strong>
           is totally funded by the payroll tax levied on employer and employee. If you reduce the outgo of 
          <strong>
            Social Security
          </strong>
          , that money would not go into the general fund to reduce a deficit. It would go into the 
          <strong>
            Social Security
          </strong>
           Trust Fund. So, 
          <strong>
            Social Security
          </strong>
           has nothing to do with balancing a budget or erasing or lowering the deficit. Now, again, to get to whether I have - am depending on magic, I think I have talked in straight economic terms about a program of recovery that was - I was told wouldn't work.

          Vice President, yes, we read your lips: no new taxes. But despite that same pledge from President Reagan, after income tax rates were cut, in each of the last five years, some Federal taxes have gone up, on

          I'd like to have that line-item veto for the president, because I think that would be extraordinarily helpful. And I won't do one other thing that he's had to do: took $29 million out of his state pension fund that's equivalent in the federal level of taking out of the

          But I suggest that we understand that those are going to be additional costs on senior citizens across this country. So I'm not going to begin, and I'm not going to go to entitlements as a means for cutting that deficit when we're spending billions on something like Star Wars, when we're spending billions on other weapons systems which apparently the Vice President wants to keep in his back pocket or some place, but which, if we continue to spend billions on them, will force us to cut 
          <strong>
            Social Security
          </strong>
          , to cut Medicare, to cut these basic entitlements to people of very, very modest means. Now there are some things we can do to help people who currently do get entitlements to get off of public assistance.

          I think i've addressed it but let me simply say for the record i did not vote to cut colas and i voted the same way that he did three months before in a national governor's conference and he said at that time quote and this is a paraphrase of fries that's easy so i don't believe that we need to do what you've suggested here and i've said that i'm going to keep this

           entitlement to keep that trust fund sound but i do think there are flexible ways to solve some of the pressing problems particularly that affect our children and i have made some good sound proposals but again we've got a big difference on childcare for example you see i want the families to have the choice i don't want to see the federal government licensing grandmother's i don't want to see the the federal government saying to communities well you can't do this anymore we're gonna tell you how to do it all i want flexibility and i do you know these people laugh about the thousand points of life you ought to go out and sit light you gotta go out and see around this country what's happening in the volunteer sector american helping america and i want to keep it alive in childcare and in other entitlements

          Governor i'm gonna pass on the question i originally plan to ask you to follow up on your rebuttal to a question andrea asked and that involves 
          <strong>
            social security
          </strong>
           now it is true as you said that originally you sought an exemption for 
          <strong>
            social security
          </strong>
           colas in this national governors association vote but when you lost that vote you then endorsed the overall fries proposal and what's more you had great criticism of your fellow governors who wouldn't go along as political cowards you said you said it takes guts well it was absolutely not true it had nothing to do with a debate on 
          <strong>
            social security
          </strong>
           and had to do with the discussion we had had the previous day and my overall question of reducing my question is aren't you demagoguing i have to i have to i just have to correct the record that simply isn't true now we're not a parliamentary body the national governors association we vote on resolutions if you don't get a 2/3 then your resolution doesn't pass but everybody knew that those of us who voted against the freezing of colas did so we did so that those mothers can go into a training program and get a decent job.

          It's still the most respected credit. So I would simply say, as these dates get close, you're going to have to reorganize and refix as we did with the

          You've got to do that; we got to get those costs down. Number 2, with regard to 
          <strong>
            Social Security
          </strong>

          <strong>
            Social Security

           is in surplus $70 billion. Six increases in the payroll tax - that means people with incomes of $51,000 a year or less pay a disproportionally high share of the federal tax burden, which is why I want some middle-class tax relief.

          First of all, there are two different things. 
          <strong>
            Social Security
          </strong>
           and Medicare are entirely different in terms of the financial stabilities. Let's talk about them separately. 
          <strong>
            Social Security
          </strong>
           is stable until, as you pointed out, at least the third decade of the next century. But we'd like to have a 
          <strong>
            Social Security
          </strong>
           fund that has about 70 years of life instead of about 30 years of life. What we have to do is simply to make some adjustments to take account of the fact that the baby boomers, people like me, are bigger in number than the people that went just before us and the people that come just after us. And I think what we'll plainly do is what we did in 1983 when Senator Dole served, and this is something I think he did a good job on when he served on the 
          <strong>
            Social Security
          </strong>
           commission and they made some modest changes in 
          <strong>

          It would save a lot of money through more managed care, by giving more options, more preventative care and lowering the inflation rate and the prices we're paying providers without having the kind of big premium increases and out-of-pocket costs that the budget I vetoed would provide. Then that would give us ten years to do with Medicare what we're going to do with

          ; have a bipartisan group look at what we have to do to save it when the baby boomers retire. But now we can, we ought to pass this budget now and put ten years on it right away so no one has to worry about it.

          You can also use those accounts for health care or education or a first home. We're doing that precisely, and I think one thing sooner or later we're going to have to consider is take a look at the

          Only about half the people in this country have pension plans. And 
          <strong>
            Social Security
          </strong>
           is not enough for a lot of people to live on, or at least is not enough for them to maintain anything like their previous lifestyle. So we've got to figure out how are we going to have more people with pension plans, and pension coverage has been declining as more and more people work for small businesses and fewer people work for big businesses.

          That's what I've been critical about the administration for. Same with 
          <strong>
            Social Security
          </strong>
          . I think there was a good opportunity to bring Republicans and Democrats together to reform the 
          <strong>
            Social Security
          </strong>
           system so seniors will never go without. Those on 
          <strong>
            Social Security
          </strong>
           today will have their promise made, but also to give younger workers the option at their choice of being able to manage some of their own money in the private sector to make sure there's a 
          <strong>
            Social Security
          </strong>
           system around tomorrow. There are a lot of young workers at our rallies we go to that when they hear I'll trust them at their option to be able to manage, under certain guidelines, some of their own money to get a better rate of return so that they'll have a retirement plan in the future, they begin to nod their heads and they want a different attitude in Washington.

          I thought we cleared this up a while ago. New question on 
          <strong>
            Social Security
          </strong>
          . Both of you have 
          <strong>
            Social Security

           reform plans, so we could spend the rest of the evening and two or three other evenings talking about them in detail. We won't do that.

          Here is my plan. I will keep 
          <strong>
            Social Security
          </strong>
           in a lockbox and that pays down the national debt. And the interest savings I would put right back into 
          <strong>
            Social Security
          </strong>
          . That extends the life of 
          <strong>
            Social Security
          </strong>
           for 55 years. Now, I think that it's very important to understand that cutting benefits under 
          <strong>
            Social Security
          </strong>
           means that people like Winifred Skinner from Des Moines, Iowa, who is here, would really have a much harder time. Because there are millions of seniors who are living almost hand to mouth.

          I am opposed to it. I'm also opposed to a plan that diverts 1 out of every $6 away from the 
          <strong>
            Social Security
          </strong>
           Trust Fund. 
          <strong>
            Social Security
          </strong>
           is a trust fund that pays the checks this year with the money that is paid into 
          <strong>
            Social Security
          </strong>
           this year. The governor wants to divert 1 out of every $6 off into the stock market, which means that he would drain a trillion dollars out of the 
          <strong>
            Social Security
          </strong>
           Trust Fund in this generation over the next ten years, and 
          <strong>
            Social Security
          </strong>
           under that approach would go bankrupt within this generation. His leading adviser on this plan actually said that would be okay, because then the 
          <strong>
            Social Security
          </strong>
           Trust Fund could start borrowing. It would borrow up to $3 trillion. Now, 
          <strong>
            Social Security
          </strong>
           has never done that. And I don't think it should do that.

          I thought it was interesting that on the two minutes he spent about a million-and-a-half on my plan, which means he doesn't want you to know what he's doing is loading up IOUs for future generations. He puts no real assets into the 
          <strong>
            Social Security

           system. The revenues exceed the expenses in 
          <strong>
            Social Security

           until the year 2015 which means all retirees are going to get the promises made. For those of you who he wants to scare into the voting booth to vote for him, hear me loud and clear.

          That you can pass on from one generation to the next. I want to get a better rate of return for your own money than the paltry 2% that the current

          <strong>
            Social Security
          </strong>
           monies coming into the trust. There is $2.3 trillion of surplus that we can use to make sure that younger workers have a

I believe that younger workers ought to be allowed to take some of their own money and put it in a personal savings account, because I understand that they need to get better rates of return than the rates of return being given in the current

          There are lots of issues that we are going to be dealing with here tonight. And we have a question from Langdon in Ballston Spa, New York, and that's about huge unfunded obligations for 
          <strong>
            Social Security
          </strong>
          , Medicare, and other entitlement programs that will soon eat up all of the revenue that's in place and then go into a deficit position. Since the rules are pretty loose here, I'm going to add my own to this one.

          Instead of having a discussion, let me just ask you as a coda to that. Would you give Congress a date certain to reform 
          <strong>
            Social Security
          </strong>
           and Medicare within two years after you take office? Because in a bipartisan way, everyone agrees, that's a big ticking time bomb that will eat us up maybe even more than the mortgage crisis.

          We're going to have a lot of work to do, so I can't guarantee that we're going to do it in the next two years, but I'd like to do it in my first term as president. But I think it's important to understand, we're not going to solve 
          <strong>
            Social Security
          </strong>
           and Medicare unless we understand the rest of our tax policies. And you know, Senator McCain, I think the "Straight Talk Express" lost a wheel on that one.

          And it doesn't work. Now, if we get our tax policies right so that they're good for the middle class, if we reverse the policies of the last eight years that got us into this fix in the first place and that Senator McCain supported, then we are going to be in a position to deal with 
          <strong>
            Social Security

          Well, Jim, our seniors depend on these programs, and I know anytime we talk about entitlements, people become concerned that something's going to happen that's going to change their life for the worse. And the answer is neither the president nor I are proposing any changes for any current retirees or near retirees, either to 
          <strong>
            Social Security
          </strong>
           or Medicare. So if you're 60 or around 60 or older, you don't need to listen any further.

          But the idea of cutting 716 billion dollars from Medicare to be able to balance the additional cost of Obamacare is, in my opinion, a mistake. And with regards to young people coming along, I've got proposals to make sure Medicare and 
          <strong>
            Social Security

           are there for them without any question.

          The one last area I want to get into with you in this debate is the fact that the biggest driver of our debt is entitlements, which is 60 percent of all federal spending. Now, the Committee for federal-a Responsible Federal Budget has looked at both of your plans and they say neither of you has a serious plan that is going to solve the fact that Medicare's going to run out of money in the 2020s, 
          <strong>
            Social Security
          </strong>
           is going to run out of money in the 2030s, and at that time, recipients are going to take huge cuts in their benefits. So, in effect, the final question I want to ask you in this regard is-and let me start with you, Mr. Trump, would President Trump make a deal to save Medicare and 
          <strong>
            Social Security
          </strong>
           that included both tax increases and benefit cuts, in effect, a grand bargain on entitlements?

          And, Secretary Clinton, same question, because at this point, 
          <strong>
            Social Security
          </strong>
           and Medicare are going to run out, the trust funds are going to run out of money. Will you as president entertain-will you consider a grand bargain, a deal that includes both tax increases and benefit cuts to try to save both programs?

          Well, Chris, I am on record as saying that we need to put more money into the 
          <strong>
            Social Security
          </strong>
           Trust Fund. That's part of my commitment to raise taxes on the wealthy. My

            Social Security
          </strong>
           payroll contribution will go up, as will Donald's, assuming he can't figure out how to get out of it. But what we want to do is to replenish the

           Trust Fund-

          I will not cut benefits. I want to enhance benefits for low-income workers and for women who have been disadvantaged by the current

            Social Security
