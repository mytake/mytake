Figuring this out is a little trickier – you’ve got to be not just a lawyer but also an historian to have any chance of understanding the law. The upside of Originalism is that it can help the law to be more stable against the whims of a changing culture – our Constitution is more than 220 years old, and a lot has changed since then! A great example is the 2nd amendment:"

It sure seems like the original intent of the 2nd amendment was to enshrine the right of the citizenry to have the means for armed rebellion."
