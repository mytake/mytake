# Name and title design

## Fundamental principles

1. We should strive for everyone's name to have the same format.
2. When a person changes their name or has a nickname, we should strive to use the name under which they prefer to be known.  If they have written a book, the name they use as an author is appropriate.
3. Event titles should not depend on the outcome.
    + e.g. If a debate's title is based on who eventually won the presidency, what do we title a debate for a content which hasn't been decided yet?

## Presidential debate titles

To make sure that titles don't depend on the outcome, we will list the candidate's names alphabetically.
