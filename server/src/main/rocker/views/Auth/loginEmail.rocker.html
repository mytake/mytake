				Welcome to MyTake.org, @username!
			</p>
			<p>
				Visit <a href="@raw(loginUrl)">this link</a> to confirm your account and login.
			</p>
			<p>
				We need help!
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Are you a programmer or designer? Make the site better, <a href="https://github.com/mytakedotorg/mtdo/blob/staging/DEV_QUICKSTART.md">send us a PR</a>!</li>
				<li>Wonder how we synced up the transcripts? <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eEVrkWPF3yj1EdVXhABOVRVcfHKLy1WX/view">Like this!</a> Can you <a href="https://meta.mytake.org/t/seeking-help-transcribing-debates/160">do some syncing</a>?</li>
				<li>Here's <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SZtK9ajcQAs8la1dqnHtc9yAWJK7j-26HBrAx-gtUDY/edit#gid=1674413579">our financial situation</a>. Reply to this email if you'd like to help turn this from a side project into a threat to establishment media.</li>
				<li>Follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/mytakedotorg">twitter</a> and like us on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mytakedotorg">facebook</a>, if you're into that.</li>
			</ul>

				We're a brand new site, so there's a good chance we'll do some crashing. But we've kept things very simple, so we'll be reliable very soon.
			</p>
			<p>
				The year has been crazy for all of us. We're doing our best to document the past. The only thing we can say about the future is that if you type "mytake.org" into your web browser in 2050, <a href="https://github.com/mytakedotorg/mtdo/blob/staging/README.md">this website that we are building together</a> will be there.
