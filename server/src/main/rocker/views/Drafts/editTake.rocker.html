@* TODO
A save button.  When you click it, it makes a post with these fields:

title="Why it's so hard to have peace" enforce length <= 255
blocks=JSON.stringify(take.blocks)
(FOR UPDATING AN EXISTING DRAFT)
draftid = draftid
lastrevid = lastrevid
(/FOR UPDATING AN EXISTING DRAFT))

The post will respond with:

{ "draftid": "123", "lastrevid": "123"}

The next time the user presses save, we need to send those values along.
