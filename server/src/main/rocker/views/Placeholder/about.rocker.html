<p class="about__text">MyTake.org is a radically transparent platform for citizens to learn about their raw, uncut history.
<ul class="about__list">
	<li class="about__list-item">We start with a <span class="about__text about__text--special">Foundation</span> of unbiased <span class="about__text about__text--special">Facts</span> everyone can agree on. Only the following make the cut:
		<ul class="about__sub-list">
		<li class="about__sub-list-item">The United States Constitution.</li>
		<li class="about__sub-list-item">Every televised presidential debate.  Always the full original source.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p class="about__text">Search these facts for yourself.  For example, here's what every Presidential Candidate has ever said about <a class="about__link" href="https://mytake.org/search?q=social%20security">Social Security</a> and <a class="about__link" href="https://mytake.org/search?q=north%20korea">North Korea</a>.  No editorializing - just their words in full context.</p>

<p class="about__text">If you find something interesting, <a class="about__link" href="https://mytake.org/drafts/new">give your take on it</a> and let your friends know what you found.</p>

<p class="about__text">How can you trust that we're not biased?</p>
